## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Deep-Learning
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Most notebooks require Python 3.8+ and packages such as NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and/or PyTorch.  
   You can install typical dependencies with:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras torch
    ```
   Some notebooks may require additional packages (see notebook headers for details).

3. **Run the notebooks:**  
   Open the desired `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code and follow the instructions in each notebook.

## Datasets

Sample datasets are included in the [sample_data](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) directory. Some notebooks will automatically download required datasets if not present.
